    	<p> In my schoolings I participated in many volleyball matches and won many trophies in<br>
    	 STATE LEVEL matches. <br>
    		I also participated in a cluster match but didnt make into the finals.<br>
    	I won gold medal in inter iiit volleyball match as a freshmen in college. <br>
          Apart from sports I have the same interest in my academics also. I was the only one in my school to get a seat in a central government college.<br> In my school I didnt have separate coaching for jee preparation and other things. It wa all my own interest and my own work to try for it. I worked hard to get to this college and after comming to college , I came to know that life doesnt end with the college we join. Life has no end point in terms of learning. You can learn from anything and everything....
